To running the greedy algorithm for TSP
We need file_reader.py to read the txt file and tsp_greedy.py to solve the TSP.

To run the algorithm by using following command:

python tsp_greedy.py [input_file_name].txt

To check the result by using following command:

python tsp-verifier.py [input_file_name].txt [input_file_name].txt.tour
